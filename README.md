This is a simple application, which displays a list of courses, coming from MongoDB (at the moment seeded with dummy data). The user is able to pick courses by date and/or by category. When the user clicks on any course, they are redirected to a page with more details about the course. They can go back to the home page any time by clicking on the logo in the header.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

To start docker, run `TMPDIR=/private$TMPDIR docker-compose up`


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
